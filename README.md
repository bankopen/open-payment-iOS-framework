Integrate OPEN Payment Gateway with your iOS app and start collecting payments from your customers.


## Pre-requisites

1. XCode 13 or newer
2. Cocoapods


# Create a Payment Token

A payment token represents an order or a purchase. The first step to open up a Layer payment page on your website or checkout page is to create a payment_token

A payment_token can be created by referring to [create payment token](https://docs.bankopen.com/reference#generate-token) API. This API should be always called from your server. You will receive payment_token as a response from [create payment token](https://docs.bankopen.com/reference#generate-token) API.


## Installation

OpenPayment is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'OpenPayment'
```

then run

```shell
pod install
```

## Initializing OpenPayment:
You can see below code, these are minimum and mandatory calls to enable payment processing. If any of it is missed then an error will be generated.

#### For example, consider parameters as follows.

let openPaymentBuilderObj = OpenPaymentBuilder()
    openPaymentBuilderObj.setAccessKey("accessToken")
    openPaymentBuilderObj.setEnvironment(.Sandbox)
    openPaymentBuilderObj.setPaymentToken("paymentToken") 
    openPaymentBuilderObj.setErrorColor("colorhexcode") // Optional
    openPaymentBuilderObj.setLogoUrl("Your LogoURL") // Optional
    openPaymentBuilderObj.setBgColor("colorhexcode") // Optional

let openPaymentOBj = openPaymentBuilderObj.buildObject()

openPaymentOBj.startPayment()
````

#### Description:

To get details of transactions, we have a callback method onPaymentCompleted() with a parameter of TransactionDetails.
